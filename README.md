# Supervised-Learning-Algorithms

In this project I implement 5 different supervised learning algorithms to 2 different datasets.

The 5 algorithms implemented are: Decision Trees, Neural Network, Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine, and k-Nearest Neighbors.

The 2 datasets explored: 
  1. Breast Cancer - binary classification data to detect breast cancer.
  2. Parkinson's Disease - binary classification data on speech frequencies that can help detect the onset of Parkinson's Disease.

The goal of this analysis was to compare and contrast the algorithms and tune hyperparameters for performance.
